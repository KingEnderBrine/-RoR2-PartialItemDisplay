# Description
Allows you to hide some item displays based on a character.

# InLobbyConfig
Sections are named by a character they are corresponding to.
Each section can be disabled.
The `Default` section is applied if it is enabled and a section for a character is disabled.
If you want to disable all item displays for all characters, then enable only `Default` section, select list types equal to `Whitelist`, and don't add any items/equipment to lists.
